  - Kevin Black


## Introduction
The objective of the CS 320 course project is to learn and experience processes and methods of software engineering by designing and developing a self-defined, small scale software system in a team setting. In the rest of this semester, your will work with your teammates to further explore the topic, define a software requirement specification (SRS), design a software system, implement the software system, test it and provide complete documentation and source code at the end of the semester.

The minimum expectation for the scope of the software are as follows, it: 
- Is a web application.
- Has a landing page which helps a user to understand what the application is about.
- Has multiple other pages besides the landing page.
- Has some data to maintain/manipulate.

## Software Requirements Specification (Milestone 1)
  A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide.
  Software requirements specification establishes the basis for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers on what the software product is to do as well as what it is not expected to do. Software requirements specifcation permits a rigorous assessment of requirements before design can begin and reduces later redesign.
  - Fill out each section of the document. If a section of the SRS is not applicable to your project, state this in the document and explain why.
  - Construct detailed Use-Cases (Section 3.3 of the SRS) describing scenarios of using the system.
  - Functional requirements should be described in section 3.2 and then specified using use-case diagram(s) in section 3.3.
  - State non-functional requirements in section 4.
  - Keep track of group meetings in Appendix B.
  - Use complete and precise sentences in your SRS document.
  - Use this platform to collaborate with teammates.
  
## Milestone 1 Submission (Due 10/07/2018 at 11:59pm, 20% of the final grade)
One representative needs to submit:
  - SRS document in PDF format.
  - The git log of the team work. This can be a screenshot of the commits on GitHub. Please make sure that each commit has a meaningful description.
