# CS-320-Course-Project
The objective of the CS 320 course project is to learn and experience processes and methods of software engineering by designing and developing a self-defined, small scale software system in a team setting. In the rest of this semester, your will work with your teammates to further explore the topic, define a software requirement specification (SRS), design a software system, implement the software system, test it and provide complete documentation and source code at the end of the semester. The minimum expectation for the scope of the software are as follows: It is a web application, it has a landing page which helps a user to understand what the application is about, it has multiple other pages besides the landing page, and it has some data to maintain/manipulate.
